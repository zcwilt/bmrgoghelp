Keeping your resources safe
###########################


Your main screen will show the amount of usable resources you have immediately available.
However you will also probably also have some hidden resource bundles. You can see these by
navigating to items->resources.

It's important to protect your resources, especially during the Gold Kill Event.
Anyone attacking your Castle will steal your usable resources, however your bundles will be safe.
Attacking castles can also not steal your resource that are protected by your warehouse.
